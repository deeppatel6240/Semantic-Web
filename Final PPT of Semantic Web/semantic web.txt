URI
	Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is one of the most important concepts of Semantic Web.
	A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters that is about naming, identifying, addressing, and defining resources.
	Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) is one of the key features of the Semantic Web 
	
URIs were originally defined as two types:

Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) which are addresses with network locations, and
Uniform Resource Names (URNs) which are persistent names that are address independent.


URL:
	A URL is a URI that identifies a network-homed resource and also specifies the means of acting upon or obtaining the representation
URN:
	A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a URI that identifies a resource by name, in a particular namespace. 
	A URN can be used to identify a resource without implying its location


XML
	XML is intended as a markup-language for arbitrary document structure, as opposed to HTML.
	XML provides everyone to create their own tags.
	XML will be major catalyst in constructing "semantic web"

	Here it is xml schema provides similar services
	1.it has a default namespace
	2.properties can be specify globally
	3.datatypes supported by XMLSchema are mainly variations of numerical, temporal and string datatypes.
